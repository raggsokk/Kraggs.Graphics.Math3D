** Kraggs.Graphics.Math3D
======================================================================

A 3D Math library for use with OpenGL.
That means the Matrix function is left-handed and 
matrix storage is column major.

All the structures only contain unsafe functions and no unsafe
structures for easy marshalling with opengl functions/buffers.

All the matrix functions will be compared to the GLM library 
for validating library correctness.
